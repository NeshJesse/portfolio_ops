# 👋 Hi, I'm Jake

A passionate software developer and automation enthusiast with over 5 years of experience building modern web applications and developer tools.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who loves creating solutions that make developers' lives easier. My journey started with web development, but I've since expanded into mobile development, CLI tools, and automation systems.

### What I Do

- **Web Development**: Building responsive, performant web applications with React, Next.js, and modern JavaScript
- **Mobile Development**: Creating cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter and React Native
- **Developer Tools**: Building CLI tools and automation systems to improve developer workflows
- **Open Source**: Contributing to open source projects and maintaining my own tools

### My Philosophy

I believe in the power of automation and developer experience. The best tools are the ones that get out of your way and let you focus on what matters most - building great software.

### Current Focus

Right now, I'm working on **Portfolio-OPs**, a CLI tool that automatically generates portfolio websites by scanning your local projects. It's designed to eliminate the manual work of maintaining a portfolio while keeping it always up-to-date with your latest work.

### When I'm Not Coding

- 🏃‍♂️ Running and hiking in the mountains
- 📚 Reading about new technologies and best practices
- 🎮 Gaming (especially indie games and puzzle games)
- ☕ Exploring local coffee shops

### Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing new projects, collaboration opportunities, or just chatting about technology. Feel free to reach out through any of the channels listed on my contact page!
