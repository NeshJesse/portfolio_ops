      "content": "# Shopify App Template for Node\n\nThis is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using Node and React. It contains the basics for building a Shopify app.\n\nRather than cloning this repo, you can use your preferred package manager and the Shopify CLI with [these steps](#installing-the-template).\n\n## Benefits\n\nShopify apps are built on a variety of Shopify tools to create a great merchant experience. The [create an app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create) tutorial in our developer documentation will guide you through creating a Shopify app using this template.\n\nThe Node app template comes with the following out-of-the-box functionality:\n\n- OAuth: Installing the app and granting permissions\n- GraphQL Admin API: Querying or mutating Shopify admin data\n- REST Admin API: Resource classes to interact with the API\n- Shopify-specific tooling:\n  - AppBridge\n  - Polaris\n  - Webhooks\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nThis template combines a number of third party open-source tools:\n\n- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.\n- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.\n- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for routing. We wrap this with file-based routing.\n- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) queries the Admin API.\n- [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) and related libraries are used to internationalize the frontend.\n  - [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/) is used for React-specific i18n functionality.\n  - [`i18next-resources-to-backend`](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-resources-to-backend) is used to dynamically load app translations.\n  - [`@formatjs/intl-localematcher`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-localematcher/) is used to match the user locale with supported app locales.\n  - [`@formatjs/intl-locale`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-locale) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.Locale`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) if necessary.\n  - [`@formatjs/intl-pluralrules`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-pluralrules) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.PluralRules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules) if necessary.\n\nThe following Shopify tools complement these third-party tools to ease app development:\n\n- [Shopify API library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) adds OAuth to the Express backend. This lets users install the app and grant scope permissions.\n- [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) adds [authentication to API requests](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge-library/apis/resource-fetching) in the frontend and renders components outside of the App’s iFrame.\n- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.\n- [File-based routing](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/blob/main/Routes.jsx) makes creating new pages easier.\n- [`@shopify/i18next-shopify`](https://github.com/Shopify/i18next-shopify) is a plugin for [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) that allows translation files to follow the same JSON schema used by Shopify [app extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/best-practices/localizing-ui-extensions#how-it-works) and [themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/locales/storefront-locale-files#usage).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Requirements\n\n1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.\n1. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don’t have one.\n1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).\n\n### Installing the template\n\nThis template can be installed using your preferred package manager:\n\nUsing yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn create @shopify/app --template=node\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm init @shopify/app@latest -- --template=node\n```\n\nUsing pnpm:\n\n```shell\npnpm create @shopify/app@latest --template=node\n```\n\nThis will clone the template and install the required dependencies.\n\n#### Local Development\n\n[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables, runs commands in parallel, and updates application URLs for easier development.\n\nYou can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app.\n\nUsing yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn dev\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nUsing pnpm:\n\n```shell\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nOpen the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Application Storage\n\nThis template uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to store session data. The database is a file called `database.sqlite` which is automatically created in the root. This use of SQLite works in production if your app runs as a single instance.\n\nThe database that works best for you depends on the data your app needs and how it is queried. You can run your database of choice on a server yourself or host it with a SaaS company. Here’s a short list of databases providers that provide a free tier to get started:\n\n| Database   | Type             | Hosters                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| MySQL      | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-mysql), [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com/), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql) |\n| PostgreSQL | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-postgresql), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)                                   |\n| Redis      | Key-value        | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-redis), [Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/)                                                                                                        |\n| MongoDB    | NoSQL / Document | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/try/managed-databases-mongodb), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)                                                                                                  |\n\nTo use one of these, you need to change your session storage configuration. To help, here’s a list of [SessionStorage adapter packages](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/blob/main/packages/shopify-api/docs/guides/session-storage.md).\n\n### Build\n\nThe frontend is a single page app. It requires the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, which you can find on the page for your app in your partners dashboard. Paste your app’s key in the command for the package manager of your choice:\n\nUsing yarn:\n\n```shell\ncd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME yarn build\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```shell\ncd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME npm run build\n```\n\nUsing pnpm:\n\n```shell\ncd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME pnpm run build\n```\n\nYou do not need to build the backend.\n\n## Hosting\n\nWhen you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).\n\nWhen you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.\n\n## Known issues\n\n### Hot module replacement and Firefox\n\nWhen running the app with the CLI in development mode on Firefox, you might see your app constantly reloading when you access it.\nThat happened in previous versions of the CLI, because of the way HMR websocket requests work.\n\nWe fixed this issue with v3.4.0 of the CLI, so after updating it, you can make the following changes to your app's `web/frontend/vite.config.js` file:\n\n1. Change the definition `hmrConfig` object to be:\n\n   ```js\n   const host = process.env.HOST\n     ? process.env.HOST.replace(/https?:\\/\\//, \"\")\n     : \"localhost\";\n\n   let hmrConfig;\n   if (host === \"localhost\") {\n     hmrConfig = {\n       protocol: \"ws\",\n       host: \"localhost\",\n       port: 64999,\n       clientPort: 64999,\n     };\n   } else {\n     hmrConfig = {\n       protocol: \"wss\",\n       host: host,\n       port: process.env.FRONTEND_PORT,\n       clientPort: 443,\n     };\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Change the `server.host` setting in the configs to `\"localhost\"`:\n\n   ```js\n   server: {\n     host: \"localhost\",\n     ...\n   ```\n\n### I can't get past the ngrok \"Visit site\" page\n\nWhen you’re previewing your app or extension, you might see an ngrok interstitial page with a warning:\n\n```text\nYou are about to visit <id>.ngrok.io: Visit Site\n```\n\nIf you click the `Visit Site` button, but continue to see this page, then you should run dev using an alternate tunnel URL that you run using tunneling software.\nWe've validated that [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/run-tunnel/trycloudflare/) works with this template.\n\nTo do that, you can [install the `cloudflared` CLI tool](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/), and run:\n\n```shell\n# Note that you can also use a different port\ncloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000\n```\n\nOut of the logs produced by cloudflare you will notice a https URL where the domain ends with `trycloudflare.com`. This is your tunnel URL. You need to copy this URL as you will need it in the next step.\n\n```shell\n2022-11-11T19:57:55Z INF Requesting new quick Tunnel on trycloudflare.com...\n2022-11-11T19:57:58Z INF +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n2022-11-11T19:57:58Z INF |  Your quick Tunnel has been created! Visit it at (it may take some time to be reachable):  |\n2022-11-11T19:57:58Z INF |  https://randomly-generated-hostname.trycloudflare.com                                     |\n2022-11-11T19:57:58Z INF +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\nBelow you would replace `randomly-generated-hostname` with what you have copied from the terminal. In a different terminal window, navigate to your app's root and with the URL from above you would call:\n\n```shell\n# Using yarn\nyarn dev --tunnel-url https://randomly-generated-hostname.trycloudflare.com:3000\n# or using npm\nnpm run dev --tunnel-url https://randomly-generated-hostname.trycloudflare.com:3000\n# or using pnpm\npnpm dev --tunnel-url https://randomly-generated-hostname.trycloudflare.com:3000\n```\n\n## Developer resources\n\n- [Introduction to Shopify apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started)\n- [App authentication](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth)\n- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli)\n- [Shopify API Library documentation](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js#readme)\n- [Getting started with internationalizing your app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/best-practices/internationalization/getting-started)\n  - [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)\n    - [Configuration options](https://www.i18next.com/overview/configuration-options)\n  - [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)\n    - [`useTranslation` hook](https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook)\n    - [`Trans` component usage with components array](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component#alternative-usage-components-array)\n  - [i18n-ally VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)\n",

      "content": "Thanks — I’ve fully reviewed the README you uploaded.\n\nYou're using the modern Shopify Node app template (based on Express + Vite + React + React Router), and here's what that changes for our plan:\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Key Takeaways from the README\n\n1. This is not \"backendless\" — it still uses an Express backend under the hood (with OAuth, Admin API access, sessions, and webhooks).\n2. You don't need to manually build routes like /server/routes/api.js from scratch — Shopify CLI already wires up a working Express server with session-aware Admin API access.\n3. Your backend lives under the /web directory (e.g. /web/index.js, /web/middleware).\n4. You don’t need to touch the frontend inside this repo since you’ve already deployed your own widget on Vercel.\n5. Shopify App Bridge and Admin API functionality is still present and supported.\n\nSo your original plan (OAuth, access token storage, and Admin API product access) is still correct — we just need to align with the newer directory structure.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ What You Should Do Next\n\nNow that your Shopify Node app is working and installed on your test store:\n\n### 1. Inject Your Widget into the Storefront via ScriptTag API\n\nThis part is still 100% valid.\n\nWe'll add code to the afterAuth lifecycle in your app backend to register a ScriptTag that loads your hosted widget.js (from Vercel) into the storefront.\n\nWe’ll do this inside:\n\n📁 web/index.js → in the afterAuth section\n\nI’ll walk you through that once you confirm you're ready.\n\n—\n\n### 2. Add Backend API Routes for Your Widget to Use\n\nYour widget (on the storefront) will fetch:\n\n* Product data via GET /api/products\n* Checkout links via POST /api/checkout\n\nWe’ll define these two routes using the Express router in:\n\n📁 web/index.js or in a new 📁 web/routes/widget.js file (I’ll help set that up cleanly)\n\n—\n\n### 3. Secure the Routes with Session Validation\n\nEach route will need to:\n\n* Load the merchant session from the session store\n* Use the stored access token to call the Shopify Admin or Storefront API\n\nThis logic is already handled via Shopify's SDK and middleware. We’ll just reuse it.\n\n—\n\n✅ Summary:\n\n* You’re not backendless — you just don’t need to manually configure Koa or separate folders anymore\n* The app is Express + Vite + React under a monorepo structure (web/ folder holds everything)\n* Your own storefront widget hosted on Vercel is a separate concern — but it will now fetch from this app’s backend\n\n—\n\n🧭 Next Step:\n\nShall I help you write the ScriptTag injection code inside web/index.js now? That’s the most direct next move.\n",

      "content": "# dev_brief\n\nTo create a simple and valuable Flutter app with SQLite for developers to manage their local projects, you need to focus on delivering the most essential information and designing an intuitive first screen. Since the app launches automatically when the laptop or desktop starts and operates locally, it should provide a quick, actionable overview of all local projects and their statuses. Below, I’ll outline the key information to prioritize and how to structure the UI for the first screen to maximize its usefulness.\n\n### Information to Prioritize\nFor the app to be valuable, it should focus on the following pieces of information, which are critical for developers to manage their projects effectively:\n\n- **Project Name**: This is the primary identifier for each project, making it easy for the developer to recognize their work at a glance.\n- **Status**: Clearly indicate whether a project is **unfinished**, **dead**, or **finished**. This helps the developer quickly assess which projects require attention or can be ignored.\n- **Last Launched Date**: Show the date when the project was last opened through the app. This provides insight into recent activity and helps prioritize tasks, reflecting the developer’s interaction with the project via this tool.\n- **Project Path**: Store the file system path to the project directory. This is essential for enabling the \"Launch in VS Code\" feature, allowing seamless access to the project.\n\nThese elements ensure the app delivers concise, actionable data without overwhelming the user.\n\n### UI Structure for the First Screen\nThe first screen should be clean, intuitive, and focused on providing an immediate overview of projects, with quick access to key actions for unfinished projects. Here’s how it should be structured:\n\n#### **App Bar**\n- **Title**: Display the app name (e.g., \"Project Manager\") to provide context.\n- **Settings Icon**: Include an icon (e.g., a gear) on the right side that opens a settings page. This allows the developer to configure options like the VS Code executable path or app preferences.\n\n#### **Filter Tabs**\n- Provide a row of filter tabs below the app bar to sort projects by status:\n  - **All**: Shows every project regardless of status.\n  - **Unfinished**: Displays only unfinished projects (set as the default view).\n  - **Dead**: Shows projects marked as dead.\n  - **Finished**: Lists completed projects.\n- **Default View**: Set to \"Unfinished\" since these are the projects most likely needing attention when the developer starts their device. This focuses the app on actionable tasks right away.\n\n#### **Project Cards**\n- Use a scrollable list of cards to display projects based on the selected filter. Each card should include:\n  - **Project Name**: In bold text for emphasis and easy scanning.\n  - **Status**: Displayed with color-coding for quick recognition:\n    - Yellow for **unfinished** (indicating active work).\n    - Red for **dead** (signaling abandonment).\n    - Green for **finished** (showing completion).\n  - **Last Launched Date**: Shown as \"Last Launched: [date]\" to indicate the last time the project was opened via the app.\n  - **Actions for Unfinished Projects**:\n    - **\"Launch in VS Code\" Button**: A button that opens the project directory in VS Code using the stored project path.\n    - **Gravestone Icon**: A clickable icon (e.g., a tombstone) to mark the project as dead, updating its status in the database after a confirmation prompt.\n\n#### **Optional Enhancements**\n- **Search Bar**: Add a search field above the project list to let developers quickly find projects by name, enhancing usability for those with many projects.\n- **Project Counters**: Display a count in the app bar or near the filter tabs (e.g., \"Unfinished Projects: 5\") to give an instant sense of workload.\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Prioritized Information**: The focus on project name, status, last launched date, and path ensures the developer gets the most relevant details without clutter. The \"Last Launched\" date, updated when a project is opened via the app, keeps the info practical and tied to app usage.\n- **UI Design**: The app bar, filter tabs, and project cards create a structured, glanceable interface. Defaulting to unfinished projects aligns with the developer’s likely intent—starting work—while color-coded statuses and action buttons make it fast and easy to act on projects.\n- **Local Focus**: Since all operations are local, the SQLite database (with a simple table for id, name, status, path, and last_launched) and Flutter’s lightweight widgets ensure quick startup and responsiveness, fitting the autostart requirement.\n\nThis approach delivers a valuable tool that simplifies project management, keeps the developer focused, and integrates seamlessly into their workflow.\n\n\nadd a quotes tab :the magic you are looking for is in the work yo are avoiding\n",

TanStack) | ➡ `ProductTable`, split with `ProductTableRow`, `VerifyButton`, `StatusBadge` |\n| Stats summary                | ➡ `ProductStats`                                                              |\n| Enquiry button               | ➡ `SubmitPanel`                                                               |\n| Instructions                 | Already separated                                                             |\n| CRUD & logic                 | ➡ `useProductManager`, `useSupplierVerification`, `useEnquirySubmission`      |\n| State sharing                | via `ProductContext` (context + provider + hook)                              |\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Next Steps**\n\nI'll now begin breaking this down starting with:\n\n1. `ProductContext` — to store and manage `products`, `setProducts`, `supplierSearch`, etc.\n2. `CSVUploader` — since it's isolated\n3. `ProductStats`\n4. `useProductManager` for CRUD\n5. `ProductTable` with shared cells\n6. `useSupplierVerification` + `VerifyButton`\n7. `SubmitPanel` + `useEnquirySubmission`\n\n---\n\nShall I proceed with implementation in that order? You’ll get clean `tsx` files for each, starting from `ProductContext`.\n\nProposed by deepseek after we begin integrating backend functionality\ncomponents/\n├── features/\n│   ├── CSVUploader/\n│   │   ├── index.tsx\n│   │   └── useCSVParser.ts      # Extracted CSV parsing logic\n│   ├── ProductTable/\n│   │   ├── index.tsx            # Main table container\n│   │   ├── TableHeader.tsx      # Enhanced header with verification controls\n│   │   ├── TableBody.tsx        # Optimized row rendering\n│   │   ├── ProductTableRow.tsx  # Individual row component\n│   │   ├── PriceCell.tsx        # Specialized price display\n│   │   ├── SupplierCell.tsx     # Supplier input with verification\n│   │   └── types.ts             # Table-specific types\n│   ├── ProductStats/\n│   │   ├── index.tsx\n│   │   └── VerificationStats.tsx # New verification metrics\n│   ├── SubmitPanel/\n│   │   ├── index.tsx\n│   │   └── EnquiryProgress.tsx  # Playwright submission progress\n│   └── Instructions/\n│       ├── index.tsx\n│       └── VerificationGuide.tsx # Playwright verification help\n├── shared/\n│   ├── StatusBadge.tsx          # Enhanced with verification states\n│   ├── VerifyButton.tsx         # With Playwright status handling\n│   └── ProductImage.tsx         # New component for product images\n│\nhooks/\n├── useProductManager.ts         # Now handles verification state\n├── useSupplierVerification.ts   # Playwright verification logic\n├── useEnquirySubmission.ts      # Playwright submission flow\n└── useTableColumns.ts          # Column configuration\n│\ncontext/\n├── ProductContext.tsx           # Enhanced context\n└── PlaywrightContext.tsx        # New context for Playwright status\n\n\nKey Files with Playwright Integration\ncomponents/features/ProductTable/types.ts\n\ntypescript\nexport interface VerifiedProduct extends Product {\n  verifiedSupplier: boolean;\n  verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed';\n  priceRange?: string;\n  productImage?: string;\n  lastVerified?: Date;\n}\n\nexport type ProductTableColumn = {\n  id: keyof VerifiedProduct;\n  header: string | ReactNode;\n  cell: (product: VerifiedProduct) => ReactNode;\n  width?: number;\n  meta?: {\n    editable: boolean;\n    required: boolean;\n  };\n};\nhooks/useSupplierVerification.ts\n\ntypescript\nimport { useCallback } from 'react';\nimport { verifySupplier } from '@/services/playwright';\n\nexport const useSupplierVerification = () => {\n  const verify = useCallback(async (product: Product) => {\n    try {\n      const result = await verifySupplier({\n        productName: product.productName,\n        supplierName: product.supplier,\n        specifications: product.specifications\n      });\n      \n      return {\n        ...product,\n        verifiedSupplier: result.verified,\n        priceRange: result.priceRange,\n        productImage: result.productImage,\n        verificationStatus: result.verified ?

But developers have unique needs:\n\n* Your projects live in **folders**, not \"cards\"\n* You juggle **ideas, repos, todos, and experiments**\n* You often want **no cloud**, **no login**, and **no distractions**\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n* 📂 **Add local project folders**\n* 📝 **Attach metadata**: description, tag (learning, monetization, etc.), priority\n* ✅ **Track tasks** per project (TODOs, fixes, enhancements)\n* 🌑 **Dark mode**, clean UI, distraction-free UX\n* 🔗 **Optional GitHub link** per project\n* 🧠 **Everything is stored locally** with SQLite (via Drift)\n\n---\n\n## 🔒 Designed for Solo Devs\n\n* No team collaboration bloat\n* No cloud sync unless *you* want it\n* Just a simple dashboard for *you and your code*\n\n---\n\n## 🔧 Built With\n\n* Flutter (Desktop)\n* Drift (SQLite)\n* `dart:io` for file access\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Coming Soon\n\n* 🧠 Language detection (detect if a project is Python, Flutter, etc.)\n* 🗑️ Project archiving\n* 🔔 Smart reminders (e.g. \"Haven’t touched this in 7 days\")\n* 📈 Personal progress stats\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Perfect for\n\n* Hackathon projects\n* Experiments\n* Startups in stealth\n* Weekend apps\n* Your own code garden 🌱\n\n---\n\n## 📷 Screenshots\n\n*(Add screenshots when ready)*\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Philosophy\n\n> Don’t over-plan your projects. Track the essentials. Ship more.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you’ve picked a name — I can adjust this copy and turn it into a landing page draft or GitHub README with badges, instructions, and styling.\n\nWould you like help with:\n\n* Choosing the final name and logo tagline?\n* Creating screenshots and sample projects to bundle?\n* Generating a one-page **landing site**?\n\nWe can go full indie-product launch mode if you want.",

      "content": "# Simple Private Vault\nA tiny, cross‑platform file encrypter that keeps sensitive photos/videos out of casual search and prying eyes.\n\n### What it does\n- Encrypts your selected files and folders (recursively) into a **hidden vault** folder.\n- Uses industry‑standard crypto (Fernet: AES + HMAC via `cryptography`).\n- Stores encrypted blobs with **random filenames** so original names don’t leak.\n- Keeps an **encrypted manifest** of original names/relative paths (not visible to search).\n- Makes a **best‑effort** to keep the vault out of Windows Search / Spotlight / Linux indexers.\n- On Linux/Ubuntu, tightens permissions: vault dir `700`; key/manifest/blobs `600`.\n\n### What it **doesn’t** do\n- Bulletproof, forensic‑level secrecy. It’s meant to keep kids/guests/friends from stumbling across things in File Explorer/Finder/Tracker search.\n- Guaranteed secure deletion. Wiping files on SSDs is tricky; see Tips below.\n\n---\n\n## Install\n1. Install Python 3.9+.\n2. Install deps:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n## Quick start\n```bash\n# 1) Create a vault + key file (or use a passphrase)\npython simple_vault.py init\n\n# 2) Encrypt files/folders into the vault (recursively)\npython simple_vault.py encrypt \"D:\\Pictures\\College Party\" --wipe   # Windows example\npython simple_vault.py encrypt ~/Movies/PrivateClips --wipe         # macOS/Linux example\n# Ubuntu/Linux example from Desktop project folder\npython3 simple_vault.py encrypt ~/Downloads/GooglePhotos/ --wipe\n\n# 3) See what’s stored (from encrypted manifest)\npython simple_vault.py list\n\n# 4) Restore files when you need them\npython simple_vault.py decrypt --output ~/Restored\n```\n\n### Where is the vault?\n- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\\SystemData\\.vault` (marked *hidden*, *system*, *not content indexed*).\n- **macOS:** `~/Library/PrivateVault.noindex` (Spotlight ignores `*.noindex`; folder is also hidden).\n- **Linux/Ubuntu:** `~/.private_vault` (drops `.nomedia` & `.hidden` markers and sets perms to `700`).\n\nYou can override the location with `--vault <path>` on any command.\n\n### Key vs Passphrase\n- **Key file (default):** A `vault.key` is created inside the vault. **Back it up** to a USB or password manager.\n- **Passphrase mode:** Use `--passphrase` to avoid a key file; you’ll be prompted each time.\n\n> Lose the key/passphrase = permanent data loss. There’s no backdoor.\n\n### Keep it out of search (best effort)\n- **Windows:** vault folder is `hidden + system + not content indexed`. Also placed under `AppData\\Roaming` to reduce visibility.\n- **macOS:** vault ends with `.noindex` so Spotlight won’t index it. We also mark it hidden.\n- **Linux/Ubuntu:** dot‑folder with `.nomedia`/`.hidden` and restrictive perms `700`. Desktop indexers vary by distro; most skip hidden folders.\n\n### Tips for safer deletion\n- Use `--wipe` to best‑effort overwrite originals before deleting (okay for HDDs; SSDs are tricky).\n- For stronger deletion:\n  - **Windows:** run `sdelete` from Microsoft Sysinternals on the source folders.\n  - **macOS/Linux:** use `shred` on HDDs. For SSDs, rely on encryption, then securely erase the device if ever needed.\n\n### Examples\n```bash\n# Encrypt a single file\npython simple_vault.py encrypt ~/Pictures/IMG_1234.JPG --wipe\n\n# Encrypt a folder (recursively)\npython simple_vault.py encrypt \"D:\\Camera Uploads\" --wipe --flatten\npython simple_vault.py encrypt ~/Downloads/GooglePhotos --wipe\n\n# Decrypt to a specific folder\npython simple_vault.py decrypt --output \"D:\\Private Restore\"\npython simple_vault.py decrypt --output ~/Restored\n\n# By default, subfolders are preserved under the output directory\npython simple_vault.py decrypt --output ~/Restored\n\n# Or flatten (dump all files into one folder)\npython simple_vault.py decrypt --output ~/Restored --flatten\n```\n\n### FAQ\n**Q: Will File Explorer / Finder search find my private files?**  \nA: No—the originals are encrypted into a hidden vault with randomized names, and the vault is marked to avoid indexing. This keeps them out of casual search. (An expert with admin tools could still find the vault exists.)\n\n**Q: Can I move the vault to an external drive?**  \nA: Yes. Use `--vault X:\\SomeHiddenFolder` (Windows) or `/Volumes/Drive/Hidden.noindex` (macOS), then `init` there and `encrypt` as usual.\n\n**Q: Can I use one vault on two laptops?**  \nA: Yes, but share the **same** key or passphrase. Keep good backups.\n\n**Q: What video/photo apps can open files inside the vault?**  \nA: None. Files are encrypted. Decrypt first into a temporary folder, view, then delete when done.\n\n**Q: How are paths stored in the manifest now?**  \nA: Paths are stored relative to the encrypted root(s). On decrypt, the original sub‑folder structure is recreated under your chosen output directory unless you pass `--flatten`.\n\n---\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Test with a couple of dummy files first and back up your key. This tool is intended for convenience privacy, not adversarial protection against forensics.\n",

      "content": "# dev_brief\n\nTo create a simple and valuable Flutter app with SQLite for developers to manage their local projects, you need to focus on delivering the most essential information and designing an intuitive first screen. Since the app launches automatically when the laptop or desktop starts and operates locally, it should provide a quick, actionable overview of all local projects and their statuses. Below, I’ll outline the key information to prioritize and how to structure the UI for the first screen to maximize its usefulness.\n\n### Information to Prioritize\nFor the app to be valuable, it should focus on the following pieces of information, which are critical for developers to manage their projects effectively:\n\n- **Project Name**: This is the primary identifier for each project, making it easy for the developer to recognize their work at a glance.\n- **Status**: Clearly indicate whether a project is **unfinished**, **dead**, or **finished**. This helps the developer quickly assess which projects require attention or can be ignored.\n- **Last Launched Date**: Show the date when the project was last opened through the app. This provides insight into recent activity and helps prioritize tasks, reflecting the developer’s interaction with the project via this tool.\n- **Project Path**: Store the file system path to the project directory. This is essential for enabling the \"Launch in VS Code\" feature, allowing seamless access to the project.\n\nThese elements ensure the app delivers concise, actionable data without overwhelming the user.\n\n### UI Structure for the First Screen\nThe first screen should be clean, intuitive, and focused on providing an immediate overview of projects, with quick access to key actions for unfinished projects. Here’s how it should be structured:\n\n#### **App Bar**\n- **Title**: Display the app name (e.g., \"Project Manager\") to provide context.\n- **Settings Icon**: Include an icon (e.g., a gear) on the right side that opens a settings page. This allows the developer to configure options like the VS Code executable path or app preferences.\n\n#### **Filter Tabs**\n- Provide a row of filter tabs below the app bar to sort projects by status:\n  - **All**: Shows every project regardless of status.\n  - **Unfinished**: Displays only unfinished projects (set as the default view).\n  - **Dead**: Shows projects marked as dead.\n  - **Finished**: Lists completed projects.\n- **Default View**: Set to \"Unfinished\" since these are the projects most likely needing attention when the developer starts their device. This focuses the app on actionable tasks right away.\n\n#### **Project Cards**\n- Use a scrollable list of cards to display projects based on the selected filter. Each card should include:\n  - **Project Name**: In bold text for emphasis and easy scanning.\n  - **Status**: Displayed with color-coding for quick recognition:\n    - Yellow for **unfinished** (indicating active work).\n    - Red for **dead** (signaling abandonment).\n    - Green for **finished** (showing completion).\n  - **Last Launched Date**: Shown as \"Last Launched: [date]\" to indicate the last time the project was opened via the app.\n  - **Actions for Unfinished Projects**:\n    - **\"Launch in VS Code\" Button**: A button that opens the project directory in VS Code using the stored project path.\n    - **Gravestone Icon**: A clickable icon (e.g., a tombstone) to mark the project as dead, updating its status in the database after a confirmation prompt.\n\n#### **Optional Enhancements**\n- **Search Bar**: Add a search field above the project list to let developers quickly find projects by name, enhancing usability for those with many projects.\n- **Project Counters**: Display a count in the app bar or near the filter tabs (e.g., \"Unfinished Projects: 5\") to give an instant sense of workload.\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Prioritized Information**: The focus on project name, status, last launched date, and path ensures the developer gets the most relevant details without clutter. The \"Last Launched\" date, updated when a project is opened via the app, keeps the info practical and tied to app usage.\n- **UI Design**: The app bar, filter tabs, and project cards create a structured, glanceable interface. Defaulting to unfinished projects aligns with the developer’s likely intent—starting work—while color-coded statuses and action buttons make it fast and easy to act on projects.\n- **Local Focus**: Since all operations are local, the SQLite database (with a simple table for id, name, status, path, and last_launched) and Flutter’s lightweight widgets ensure quick startup and responsiveness, fitting the autostart requirement.\n\nThis approach delivers a valuable tool that simplifies project management, keeps the developer focused, and integrates seamlessly into their workflow.\n\n\nadd a quotes tab :the magic you are looking for is in the work yo are avoiding\n\nBased on the README and project structure, here's how the app will work when a user opens their computer:\n\n## User Scenario: Developer Starts Their Day\n\n### 1. **Computer Boots Up**\n- The app **auto-starts** in the background\n- SQLite database loads with all saved projects\n- App window appears on screen (likely minimized to system tray or taskbar)\n\n### 2. **App Launches - Dashboard Screen**\n```\nDashboard Screen (Default View)\n├── App Bar: \"dev_brief\" + Settings Icon\n├── Filter Tabs: [All] [Unfinished] [Dead] [Finished]\n├── Project Counter: \"Unfinished Projects: 5\"\n├── Search Bar: \"Search projects...\"\n└── Project Cards List (Default: Unfinished projects)\n```\n\n### 3. **What the Developer Sees**\nThe dashboard shows **unfinished projects by default** (most actionable):\n\n**Project Card Example:**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ My Flutter App (Unfinished) 🟡      │\n│ Last Launched: 2024-01-15           │\n│                                     │\n│ [Launch in VS Code] [🗿 Mark Dead]  │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### 4. **Developer Actions**\n- **Quick Scan**: Developer sees 5 unfinished projects at a glance\n- **Launch Project**: Clicks \"Launch in VS Code\" → VS Code opens with project\n- **Mark Dead**: Clicks gravestone icon → Project status changes to \"Dead\" (red)\n- **Switch Views**: Can filter to see all projects, dead, or finished ones\n- **Search**: Types project name to quickly find specific project\n\n### 5. **File Scanning Feature**\nThe `features/file_scan/` handles:\n- **Auto-discovery**: Scans common dev directories for new projects\n- **Path Detection**: Identifies project roots (looks for `.git`, `pubspec.yaml`, etc.)\n- **Database Sync**: Adds new projects to SQLite database\n- **Status Updates**: Updates \"last launched\" timestamps\n\n### 6. **Settings Integration**\nDeveloper can configure:\n- VS Code executable path\n- Auto-scan directories\n- App startup behavior\n- Theme preferences\n\n### 7. **Quotes Widget**\nA motivational widget shows:\n```\n\"The magic you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding\"\n```\n- Appears on dashboard or as a separate tab\n- Provides motivation to tackle unfinished projects\n\n## Key Workflow Benefits:\n1. **Immediate Focus**: Shows unfinished work first (what needs attention)\n2. **Quick Access**: One-click VS Code launch\n3. **Project Cleanup**: Easy way to mark dead projects\n4. **Local & Fast**: No internet needed, instant startup\n5. **Always Available**: Auto-starts with computer\n\n## Technical Flow:\n```\nComputer Boot → App Auto-starts → Load SQLite DB → \nShow Dashboard → Display Unfinished Projects → \nUser Clicks \"Launch\" → Update last_launched → \nOpen VS Code → User works on project\n```",

and descriptions\n```\n\n---\n\n## Workflows\n\n### First-Time Setup\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone or create portfolio-ops\ncd ~/Desktop\ngit clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-ops.git\ncd portfolio-ops\n\n# 2. Install Python dependencies\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n# 3. Initialize\npython3 portfolio.py init\n\n# Output:\n# ✓ Created portfolio-data directory\n# ✓ Created config file\n# ✓ Ready to scan!\n```\n\n### Daily Workflow\n\n```bash\n# Morning: Work on projects\ncd ~/Desktop/my-new-project\n# ... code, commit, push ...\n\n# Afternoon: Update portfolio\ncd ~/Desktop\npython3 portfolio.py update\n\n# Output:\n# Scanning ~/Desktop...\n# ✓ Found 3 new projects\n# ✓ Updated 2 existing projects\n# ✓ Exported to portfolio-data/projects.json\n# ✓ Copied 5 screenshots\n# \n# Summary:\n#   Total Projects: 15\n#   Featured: 5\n#   Categories: Web (8), Mobile (3), CLI (4)\n\n# If you have the Next.js dev server running, it auto-reloads!\n```\n\n### Publishing Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Scan projects\npython3 portfolio.py generate\n\n# 2. Navigate to portfolio website\ncd ~/Desktop/portfolio-website\n\n# 3. Copy data (or use symlink)\ncp -r ../portfolio-data ./public/\n\n# 4. Build and deploy\nnpm run build\nvercel deploy --prod\n\n# Done! Portfolio live at: https://yourname.vercel.app\n```\n\n### Incremental Update Logic\n\n```python\n# portfolio.py update command does:\n\n1. Load cache.json\n2. For each project directory:\n   - Check if it exists in cache\n   - Compare last modified timestamp\n   - If unchanged → Skip (fast!)\n   - If changed → Re-scan metadata\n   - If new → Full scan\n3. Only process changed projects\n4. Update cache.json\n5. Export new projects.json\n\n# Result: Update takes 2-5 seconds instead of 30+ seconds\n```\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n- Python 3.8+\n- Node.js 18+\n- Git (for git metadata extraction)\n```\n\n### Python Setup\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n# requirements.txt:\n# GitPython==3.1.40\n# PyYAML==6.0.1\n# markdown==3.5.1\n# python-frontmatter==1.0.0\n# Pillow==10.1.0  # For image processing\n```\n\n### Next.js Setup\n\n```bash\n# Create Next.js app\nnpx create-next-app@latest portfolio-website --typescript --tailwind --app\n\n# Install dependencies\ncd portfolio-website\nnpm install react-markdown remark-gfm rehype-highlight\nnpm install react-syntax-highlighter\nnpm install @types/react-syntax-highlighter --save-dev\n```\n\n### Development Environment\n\n```bash\n# Terminal 1: Watch for project changes\ncd ~/Desktop\npython3 portfolio.py watch  # Auto-runs update on file changes\n\n# Terminal 2: Next.js dev server\ncd ~/Desktop/portfolio-website\nnpm run dev\n\n# Open: http://localhost:3000\n# Changes to projects instantly reflect!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### portfolio-config.yaml\n\n```yaml\nscanner:\n  root_path: \"~/Desktop\"\n  max_depth: 3\n  ignore_dirs:\n    - node_modules\n    - venv\n    - .git\n    - build\n    - dist\n    - __pycache__\n  \n  file_patterns:\n    javascript: [\"package.json\"]\n    python: [\"requirements.txt\", \"setup.py\", \"pyproject.toml\"]\n    flutter: [\"pubspec.yaml\"]\n    rust: [\"Cargo.toml\"]\n    go: [\"go.mod\"]\n\noutput:\n  data_dir: \"./portfolio-data\"\n  copy_assets: true\n  max_asset_size_mb: 5\n  \n  screenshot_dirs:\n    - screenshots\n    - docs/images\n    - assets\n    - .github/images\n\ndisplay:\n  auto_feature_threshold: 100  # Projects with 100+ commits auto-featured\n  default_category: \"Uncategorized\"\n  \n  visibility_rules:\n    - pattern: \"test-*\"\n      visibility: hidden\n    - pattern: \"draft-*\"\n      visibility: draft\n```\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Project Organization\n\n1. **README Guidelines**: Every project should have a README.md with:\n   - Project description\n   - Screenshots section\n   - Tech stack\n   - Features list\n\n2. **Screenshots**: Place in `screenshots/` or `docs/images/`\n\n3. **Git Commits**: Regular commits improve \"last updated\" display\n\n### Portfolio Curation\n\n```bash\n# Mark best projects as featured\npython3 portfolio.py feature awesome-project\n\n# Set categories for organization\npython3 portfolio.py categorize web-app \"Web Development\"\n\n# Hide incomplete projects\npython3 portfolio.py hide draft-project\n```\n\n### Performance Tips\n\n1. Use `update` instead of `generate` for daily scans\n2. Keep screenshot sizes under 2MB\n3. Use `.portfolioignore` file to skip certain directories\n4. Run `clean` monthly to remove stale cache\n\n---\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- **Watch Mode**: Auto-update on file changes\n- **GitHub Integration**: Pull stars, forks, issues count\n- **AI Descriptions**: Generate descriptions if README missing\n- **Screenshot Capture**: Auto-screenshot web apps\n- **Analytics**: Track which projects get most views\n- **Blog Integration**: Pull dev.to or Medium articles\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Scanner Issues\n\n**Problem**: Projects not detected\n```bash\n# Check if directory has project markers\npython3 portfolio.py validate ~/Desktop/project-name\n\n# Increase scan depth\npython3 portfolio.py generate --depth 5\n```\n\n**Problem**: Slow scans\n```bash\n# Use update instead\npython3 portfolio.py update\n\n# Or ignore large directories\npython3 portfolio.py generate --ignore node_modules,venv\n```\n\n### Next.js Issues\n\n**Problem**: Images not loading\n- Ensure assets copied to `public/portfolio-data/assets/`\n- Check Next.js `next.config.js` allows external images\n\n**Problem**: Markdown not rendering\n- Verify `projects.json` has full markdown content\n- Check ReactMarkdown configuration\n\n---\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, suggestions, or contributions:\n- GitHub: https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-ops\n- Email: your@email.com\n\n---\n\n**Happy Portfolio Building! 🚀**",

      "content": "# Planspace Feature – Technical Documentation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Planspace feature is inspired by Google Keep/Notion and allows users to create, manage, and work on multiple betting prediction slips. Each slip acts as a digital workspace for planning bets, adding matches, and tracking predictions.\n\n---\n\n## Main Components & Files\n\n### 1. `app/planspace/page.jsx` (PlanSpacePage)\n- **Purpose:** Main dashboard for all prediction slips.\n- **Functionality:**\n  - Displays all created slips as cards.\n  - Prominent \"+ Create Prediction Slip\" button opens a modal form.\n  - Manages slips state and persists slips to `localStorage`.\n  - Each slip card has a \"cook\" icon to open the slip in detail view.\n\n### 2. `components/PredictionSlipForm.jsx`\n- **Purpose:** Modal form for creating a new prediction slip.\n- **Inputs:**\n  - Space Name (slip name)\n  - Stake\n  - Target Odds\n  - (Auto-calculates expected win)\n- **On submit:** Calls parent handler to add the slip to state and localStorage.\n\n### 3. `components/PredictionSlipCard.jsx`\n- **Purpose:** Card UI for displaying a single prediction slip in the dashboard.\n- **Displays:**\n  - Slip name, stake, target odds, expected win\n  - List of matches added to the slip\n  - \"Cook\" icon button to open the slip detail page\n\n### 4. `app/planspace/[slipId]/page.jsx` (Slip Detail Page)\n- **Purpose:** Dedicated workspace for a single prediction slip.\n- **Functionality:**\n  - Loads the slip by ID from `localStorage`\n  - Displays slip details and matches\n  - Allows adding matches to the slip using the `UpcomingMatches` component\n  - Updates slip in state and `localStorage` when matches are added\n\n### 5. `components/UpcomingMatches.jsx`\n- **Purpose:** Displays a list of upcoming matches with an \"Add to [Slip Name]\" button for each.\n- **Props:**\n  - `matches`: Array of match objects to display\n  - `onAdd`: Callback when a match is added to the slip\n  - `slipName`: Name of the slip for button labeling\n\n---\n\n## Data Flow & Persistence\n- All slips are stored in React state and persisted to `localStorage` under the key `planspace_slips`.\n- When a slip is created or updated (e.g., matches added), the change is reflected in both state and `localStorage`.\n- The slip detail page loads the slip by ID from `localStorage` for direct editing.\n\n---\n\n## User Flow\n1. User lands on `/planspace` and sees all slips as cards.\n2. User clicks \"+ Create Prediction Slip\" to open the form and create a new slip.\n3. Each slip card shows summary info and a \"cook\" icon to open the slip detail page.\n4. In the slip detail page, the user can add matches from the upcoming matches list.\n5. All changes are saved to `localStorage` for persistence.\n\n---\n\n## Extensibility\n- The architecture supports adding more features, such as editing slip details, removing matches, or integrating real match data APIs.\n- The `UpcomingMatches` component can be reused or extended for filtering, searching, or advanced match selection.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Uses React state and hooks for UI interactivity.\n- Uses Next.js routing for navigation between dashboard and slip detail pages.\n- Uses `localStorage` for persistence across page reloads.\n- All components are styled with utility classes (e.g., Tailwind CSS) for a modern look.

The Resume tab provides quick access within the project context\n\n### 3. **Resume View Enhancements**\nThe `ResumeView` includes:\n- ✅ Expandable cards for detailed project info\n- ✅ Edit dialog with comprehensive form fields\n- ✅ Priority ordering\n- ✅ Current project indicators\n\n### 4. **Future UI Improvements**\nConsider adding:\n- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: For resume project priority\n- **Resume Templates**: Different layout options\n- **Export Options**: PDF, Markdown, JSON formats\n- **Preview Mode**: Live resume preview\n- **Skills Matrix**: Visual representation of skills across projects\n\n### 5. **Layout Consistency**\nYour current layout with the sidebar + main content area is clean and follows good UX patterns. The tabbed interface in the Projects screen provides good organization without overwhelming the user.\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\nOnce you test the app, you might want to:\n\n1. **Test the \"Add to Resume\" functionality** from the Projects grid\n2. **Verify the Resume tab** in the Projects screen works correctly\n3. **Test the dedicated Resume screen** navigation\n4. **Check that editing resume projects** works as expected\n5. **Verify database migrations** run correctly\n\nThe implementation should give you a solid foundation for managing both portfolio and resume projects with rich editing capabilities. Let me know how the testing goes and if you encounter any issues!",

      "content": "# dev_brief\n\nTo create a simple and valuable Flutter app with SQLite for developers to manage their local projects, you need to focus on delivering the most essential information and designing an intuitive first screen. Since the app launches automatically when the laptop or desktop starts and operates locally, it should provide a quick, actionable overview of all local projects and their statuses. Below, I’ll outline the key information to prioritize and how to structure the UI for the first screen to maximize its usefulness.\n\n### Information to Prioritize\nFor the app to be valuable, it should focus on the following pieces of information, which are critical for developers to manage their projects effectively:\n\n- **Project Name**: This is the primary identifier for each project, making it easy for the developer to recognize their work at a glance.\n- **Status**: Clearly indicate whether a project is **unfinished**, **dead**, or **finished**. This helps the developer quickly assess which projects require attention or can be ignored.\n- **Last Launched Date**: Show the date when the project was last opened through the app. This provides insight into recent activity and helps prioritize tasks, reflecting the developer’s interaction with the project via this tool.\n- **Project Path**: Store the file system path to the project directory. This is essential for enabling the \"Launch in VS Code\" feature, allowing seamless access to the project.\n\nThese elements ensure the app delivers concise, actionable data without overwhelming the user.\n\n### UI Structure for the First Screen\nThe first screen should be clean, intuitive, and focused on providing an immediate overview of projects, with quick access to key actions for unfinished projects. Here’s how it should be structured:\n\n#### **App Bar**\n- **Title**: Display the app name (e.g., \"Project Manager\") to provide context.\n- **Settings Icon**: Include an icon (e.g., a gear) on the right side that opens a settings page. This allows the developer to configure options like the VS Code executable path or app preferences.\n\n#### **Filter Tabs**\n- Provide a row of filter tabs below the app bar to sort projects by status:\n  - **All**: Shows every project regardless of status.\n  - **Unfinished**: Displays only unfinished projects (set as the default view).\n  - **Dead**: Shows projects marked as dead.\n  - **Finished**: Lists completed projects.\n- **Default View**: Set to \"Unfinished\" since these are the projects most likely needing attention when the developer starts their device. This focuses the app on actionable tasks right away.\n\n#### **Project Cards**\n- Use a scrollable list of cards to display projects based on the selected filter. Each card should include:\n  - **Project Name**: In bold text for emphasis and easy scanning.\n  - **Status**: Displayed with color-coding for quick recognition:\n    - Yellow for **unfinished** (indicating active work).\n    - Red for **dead** (signaling abandonment).\n    - Green for **finished** (showing completion).\n  - **Last Launched Date**: Shown as \"Last Launched: [date]\" to indicate the last time the project was opened via the app.\n  - **Actions for Unfinished Projects**:\n    - **\"Launch in VS Code\" Button**: A button that opens the project directory in VS Code using the stored project path.\n    - **Gravestone Icon**: A clickable icon (e.g., a tombstone) to mark the project as dead, updating its status in the database after a confirmation prompt.\n\n#### **Optional Enhancements**\n- **Search Bar**: Add a search field above the project list to let developers quickly find projects by name, enhancing usability for those with many projects.\n- **Project Counters**: Display a count in the app bar or near the filter tabs (e.g., \"Unfinished Projects: 5\") to give an instant sense of workload.\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Prioritized Information**: The focus on project name, status, last launched date, and path ensures the developer gets the most relevant details without clutter. The \"Last Launched\" date, updated when a project is opened via the app, keeps the info practical and tied to app usage.\n- **UI Design**: The app bar, filter tabs, and project cards create a structured, glanceable interface. Defaulting to unfinished projects aligns with the developer’s likely intent—starting work—while color-coded statuses and action buttons make it fast and easy to act on projects.\n- **Local Focus**: Since all operations are local, the SQLite database (with a simple table for id, name, status, path, and last_launched) and Flutter’s lightweight widgets ensure quick startup and responsiveness, fitting the autostart requirement.\n\nThis approach delivers a valuable tool that simplifies project management, keeps the developer focused, and integrates seamlessly into their workflow.\n\n\nadd a quotes tab :the magic you are looking for is in the work yo are avoiding\n",

Initialized with one empty row.  \n\n2. **`isAdded`**  \n   - **Type**: Boolean  \n   - **Purpose**: Temporarily shows \"Added to Cart!\" feedback (resets after 2 seconds).  \n\n3. **`cartCount`**  \n   - **Type**: Number  \n   - **Purpose**: Displays total items in the cart (sum of all quantities).  \n\n4. **`searchResults`**  \n   - **Type**: Array of products from `mockProducts`  \n   - **Purpose**: Stores products matching the user's search query.  \n\n5. **`showResults`**  \n   - **Type**: Boolean  \n   - **Purpose**: Toggles between the form view and search results view.  \n\n---\n\n### **Core Functions**\n1. **`useEffect` (Auto-Focus)**  \n   - **Trigger**: On component mount (`[]` dependency).  \n   - **Action**: Focuses the first product name input field for immediate typing.  \n\n2. **`handleChange(index, event)`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Updates a product field (name, brand, or quantity) as the user types.  \n   - **Logic**:  \n     - For `quantity`, ensures the value is ≥ 1.  \n     - Creates a copy of `products` array, updates the specific field, and sets state.  \n\n3. **`handleQuantityChange(index, amount)`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Increments/decrements quantity via +/- buttons.  \n   - **Logic**: Adjusts quantity while ensuring it never drops below 1.  \n\n4. **`handleAddProduct()`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Adds a new empty product row to the form.  \n\n5. **`handleAddToCart()`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Validates and submits products to the cart.  \n   - **Logic**:  \n     - Filters out empty/partial entries (requires both `name` and `brand`).  \n     - Calls `onAddToCart(validProducts)` to notify the parent.  \n     - Updates `cartCount` with the sum of quantities.  \n     - Resets the form (keeps one empty row) and shows feedback.  \n\n6. **`handleViewCart()`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Searches `mockProducts` for matches against user input.  \n   - **Logic**:  \n     - Filters `mockProducts` where `name` or `brand` partially matches any form entry.  \n     - Case-insensitive comparison.  \n     - Sets results and switches to the results view.  \n\n7. **`closeResults()`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Returns to the form view from search results.  \n\n8. **`toggleExpand()` / `precardExpand()`**  \n   - **Purpose**: Controls UI expansion states (unused in current JSX but kept for future features).  \n\n---\n\n### **Search Results Logic**\n- **Rendering**: When `showResults` is `true`, displays a grid of product cards.  \n- **Product Card Actions**:  \n  - **\"Select\" Button**: Auto-fills the first form row with the clicked product’s data and returns to the form.  \n  - **Image Handling**: Falls back to a placeholder if `imageUrl` fails to load.  \n\n---\n\n### **UI Flow**\n1. **Form Input** → **Add to Cart**  \n   - User fills product details → clicks \"Add to Cart\" → parent is notified → form resets.  \n2. **Form Input** → **View Cart & Search**  \n   - User enters partial names/brands → clicks \"View Cart\" → sees matching products → can select one to auto-fill the form.  \n3. **Checkout**  \n   - Visible only if `cartCount > 0` → triggers `onClose`.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n- **Validation**: Prevents adding empty/incomplete products.  \n- **Persistence**: Cart count persists even when the form resets.  \n- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapts to screen size (1–3 columns).  \n- **Error Handling**: Image fallback, quantity safeguards.  \n\nThis component is designed for **speed** (minimal inputs, quick search) while ensuring **robustness** (validation, error handling). Integrate with your e-commerce backend via the `onAddToCart` and `onClose` props.",

This is not \"backendless\" — it still uses an Express backend under the hood (with OAuth, Admin API access, sessions, and webhooks).\n2. You don't need to manually build routes like /server/routes/api.js from scratch — Shopify CLI already wires up a working Express server with session-aware Admin API access.\n3. Your backend lives under the /web directory (e.g. /web/index.js, /web/middleware).\n4. You don’t need to touch the frontend inside this repo since you’ve already deployed your own widget on Vercel.\n5. Shopify App Bridge and Admin API functionality is still present and supported.\n\nSo your original plan (OAuth, access token storage, and Admin API product access) is still correct — we just need to align with the newer directory structure.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ What You Should Do Next\n\nNow that your Shopify Node app is working and installed on your test store:\n\n### 1. Inject Your Widget into the Storefront via ScriptTag API\n\nThis part is still 100% valid.\n\nWe'll add code to the afterAuth lifecycle in your app backend to register a ScriptTag that loads your hosted widget.js (from Vercel) into the storefront.\n\nWe’ll do this inside:\n\n📁 web/index.js → in the afterAuth section\n\nI’ll walk you through that once you confirm you're ready.\n\n—\n\n### 2. Add Backend API Routes for Your Widget to Use\n\nYour widget (on the storefront) will fetch:\n\n* Product data via GET /api/products\n* Checkout links via POST /api/checkout\n\nWe’ll define these two routes using the Express router in:\n\n📁 web/index.js or in a new 📁 web/routes/widget.js file (I’ll help set that up cleanly)\n\n—\n\n### 3. Secure the Routes with Session Validation\n\nEach route will need to:\n\n* Load the merchant session from the session store\n* Use the stored access token to call the Shopify Admin or Storefront API\n\nThis logic is already handled via Shopify's SDK and middleware. We’ll just reuse it.\n\n—\n\n✅ Summary:\n\n* You’re not backendless — you just don’t need to manually configure Koa or separate folders anymore\n* The app is Express + Vite + React under a monorepo structure (web/ folder holds everything)\n* Your own storefront widget hosted on Vercel is a separate concern — but it will now fetch from this app’s backend\n\n—\n\n🧭 Next Step:\n\nShall I help you write the ScriptTag injection code inside web/index.js now? That’s the most direct next move.\n",

It logs into your partners account, connects to an app, provides environment variables, updates remote config, creates a tunnel and provides commands to generate extensions.\n\n### Authenticating and querying data\n\nTo authenticate and query data you can use the `shopify` const that is exported from `/app/shopify.server.js`:\n\n```js\nexport async function loader({ request }) {\n  const { admin } = await shopify.authenticate.admin(request);\n\n  const response = await admin.graphql(`\n    {\n      products(first: 25) {\n        nodes {\n          title\n          description\n        }\n      }\n    }`);\n\n  const {\n    data: {\n      products: { nodes },\n    },\n  } = await response.json();\n\n  return nodes;\n}\n```\n\nThis template comes preconfigured with examples of:\n\n1. Setting up your Shopify app in [/app/shopify.server.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/shopify.server.ts)\n2. Querying data using Graphql. Please see: [/app/routes/app.\\_index.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/app._index.tsx).\n3. Responding to webhooks in individual files such as [/app/routes/webhooks.app.uninstalled.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.app.uninstalled.tsx) and [/app/routes/webhooks.app.scopes_update.tsx](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/app/routes/webhooks.app.scopes_update.tsx)\n\nPlease read the [documentation for @shopify/shopify-app-remix](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests) to understand what other API's are available.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Application Storage\n\nThis template uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to store session data, by default using an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.\nThe database is defined as a Prisma schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.\n\nThis use of SQLite works in production if your app runs as a single instance.\nThe database that works best for you depends on the data your app needs and how it is queried.\nYou can run your database of choice on a server yourself or host it with a SaaS company.\nHere's a short list of databases providers that provide a free tier to get started:\n\n| Database   | Type             | Hosters                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| MySQL      | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mysql), [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com/), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql) |\n| PostgreSQL | SQL              | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql), [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres)                                   |\n| Redis      | Key-value        | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-redis), [Amazon MemoryDB](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/)                                                                                                        |\n| MongoDB    | NoSQL / Document | [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mongodb), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)                                                                                                  |\n\nTo use one of these, you can use a different [datasource provider](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#datasource) in your `schema.prisma` file, or a different [SessionStorage adapter package](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-api-js/blob/main/packages/shopify-api/docs/guides/session-storage.md).\n\n### Build\n\nRemix handles building the app for you, by running the command below with the package manager of your choice:\n\nUsing yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn build\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm run build\n```\n\nUsing pnpm:\n\n```shell\npnpm run build\n```\n\n## Hosting\n\nWhen you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).\n\nWhen you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.\n\n### Hosting on Vercel\n\nUsing the Vercel Preset is recommended when hosting your Shopify Remix app on Vercel. You'll also want to ensure imports that would normally come from `@remix-run/node` are imported from `@vercel/remix` instead. Learn more about hosting Remix apps on Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/remix).\n\n```diff\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { vitePlugin as remix } from \"@remix-run/dev\";\nimport { defineConfig, type UserConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport tsconfigPaths from \"vite-tsconfig-paths\";\n+ import { vercelPreset } from '@vercel/remix/vite';\n\ninstallGlobals();\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    remix({\n      ignoredRouteFiles: [\"**/.*\"],\n+     presets: [vercelPreset()],\n    }),\n    tsconfigPaths(),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Database tables don't exist\n\nIf you get this error:\n\n```\nThe table `main.Session` does not exist in the current database.\n```\n\nYou need to create the database for Prisma. Run the `setup` script in `package.json` using your preferred package manager.\n\n### Navigating/redirecting breaks an embedded app\n\nEmbedded Shopify apps must maintain the user session, which can be tricky inside an iFrame. To avoid issues:\n\n1. Use `Link` from `@remix-run/react` or `@shopify/polaris`. Do not use `<a>`.\n2. Use the `redirect` helper returned from `authenticate.admin`. Do not use `redirect` from `@remix-run/node`\n3. Use `useSubmit` or `<Form/>` from `@remix-run/react`. Do not use a lowercase `<form/>`.\n\nThis only applies if your app is embedded, which it will be by default.\n\n### Non Embedded\n\nShopify apps are best when they are embedded in the Shopify Admin, which is how this template is configured. If you have a reason to not embed your app please make the following changes:\n\n1. Ensure `embedded = false` is set in [shopify.app.toml`](./shopify.app.toml). [Docs here](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#global).\n2. Pass `isEmbeddedApp: false` to `shopifyApp()` in `./app/shopify.server.js|ts`.\n3. Change the `isEmbeddedApp` prop to `isEmbeddedApp={false}` for the `AppProvider` in `/app/routes/app.jsx|tsx`.\n4. Remove the `@shopify/app-bridge-react` dependency from [package.json](./package.json) and `vite.config.ts|js`.\n5. Remove anything imported from `@shopify/app-bridge-react`.  For example: `NavMenu`, `TitleBar` and `useAppBridge`.\n\n### OAuth goes into a loop when I change my app's scopes\n\nIf you change your app's scopes and authentication goes into a loop and fails with a message from Shopify that it tried too many times, you might have forgotten to update your scopes with Shopify.\nTo do that, you can run the `deploy` CLI command.\n\nUsing yarn:\n\n```shell\nyarn deploy\n```\n\nUsing npm:\n\n```shell\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\nUsing pnpm:\n\n```shell\npnpm run deploy\n```\n\n### My shop-specific webhook subscriptions aren't updated\n\nIf you are registering webhooks in the `afterAuth` hook, using `shopify.registerWebhooks`, you may find that your subscriptions aren't being updated.  \n\nInstead of using the `afterAuth` hook, the recommended approach is to declare app-specific webhooks in the `shopify.app.toml` file.  This approach is easier since Shopify will automatically update changes to webhook subscriptions every time you run `deploy` (e.g: `npm run deploy`).  Please read these guides to understand more:\n\n1. [app-specific vs shop-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions)\n2. [Create a subscription tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/get-started?framework=remix&deliveryMethod=https)\n\nIf you do need shop-specific webhooks, please keep in mind that the package calls `afterAuth` in 2 scenarios:\n\n- After installing the app\n- When an access token expires\n\nDuring normal development, the app won't need to re-authenticate most of the time, so shop-specific subscriptions aren't updated. To force your app to update the subscriptions, you can uninstall and reinstall it in your development store. That will force the OAuth process and call the `afterAuth` hook.\n\n### Admin created webhook failing HMAC validation\n\nWebhooks subscriptions created in the [Shopify admin](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/notifications/webhooks) will fail HMAC validation. This is because the webhook payload is not signed with your app's secret key.  There are 2 solutions:\n\n1. Use [app-specific webhooks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions) defined in your toml file instead (recommended)\n2. Create [webhook subscriptions](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-app-remix/v1/guide-webhooks) using the `shopifyApp` object.\n\nTest your webhooks with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#webhook-trigger) or by triggering events manually in the Shopify admin(e.g. Updating the product title to trigger a `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`).\n\n### Incorrect GraphQL Hints\n\nBy default the [graphql.vscode-graphql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) extension for VS Code will assume that GraphQL queries or mutations are for the [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin). This is a sensible default, but it may not be true if:\n\n1. You use another Shopify API such as the storefront API.\n2. You use a third party GraphQL API.\n\nin this situation, please update the [.graphqlrc.ts](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-remix/blob/main/.graphqlrc.ts) config.\n\n### First parameter has member 'readable' that is not a ReadableStream.\n\nSee [hosting on Vercel](#hosting-on-vercel).\n\n### Admin object undefined on webhook events triggered by the CLI\n\nWhen you trigger a webhook event using the Shopify CLI, the `admin` object will be `undefined`. This is because the CLI triggers an event with a valid, but non-existent, shop. The `admin` object is only available when the webhook is triggered by a shop that has installed the app.\n\nWebhooks triggered by the CLI are intended for initial experimentation testing of your webhook configuration. For more information on how to test your webhooks, see the [Shopify CLI documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/commands#webhook-trigger).\n\n### Using Defer & await for streaming responses\n\nTo test [streaming using defer/await](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/streaming) during local development you'll need to use the Shopify CLI slightly differently:\n\n1. First setup ngrok: https://ngrok.com/product/secure-tunnels\n2. Create an ngrok tunnel on port 8080: `ngrok http 8080`.\n3. Copy the forwarding address. This should be something like: `https://f355-2607-fea8-bb5c-8700-7972-d2b5-3f2b-94ab.ngrok-free.app`\n4. In a separate terminal run `yarn shopify app dev --tunnel-url=TUNNEL_URL:8080` replacing `TUNNEL_URL` for the address you copied in step 3.\n\nBy default the CLI uses a cloudflare tunnel. Unfortunately it cloudflare tunnels wait for the Response stream to finish, then sends one chunk.\n\nThis will not affect production, since tunnels are only for local development.\n\n### Using MongoDB and Prisma\n\nBy default this template uses SQLlite as the database. It is recommended to move to a persisted database for production. If you choose to use MongoDB, you will need to make some modifications to the schema and prisma configuration. For more information please see the [Prisma MongoDB documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/mongodb).\n\nAlternatively you can use a MongDB database directly with the [MongoDB session storage adapter](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/apps/session-storage/shopify-app-session-storage-mongodb).\n\n#### Mapping the id field\n\nIn MongoDB, an ID must be a single field that defines an @id attribute and a @map(\"\\_id\") attribute.\nThe prisma adapter expects the ID field to be the ID of the session, and not the \\_id field of the document.\n\nTo make this work you can add a new field to the schema that maps the \\_id field to the id field. For more information see the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/models#defining-an-id-field)\n\n```prisma\nmodel Session {\n  session_id  String    @id @default(auto()) @map(\"_id\") @db.ObjectId\n  id          String    @unique\n...\n}\n```\n\n#### Error: The \"mongodb\" provider is not supported with this command\n\nMongoDB does not support the [prisma migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/understanding-prisma-migrate/overview) command. Instead, you can use the [prisma db push](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#db-push) command and update the `shopify.web.toml` file with the following commands. If you are using MongoDB please see the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/mongodb) for more information.\n\n```toml\n[commands]\npredev = \"npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push\"\ndev = \"npm exec remix vite:dev\"\n```\n\n#### Prisma needs to perform transactions, which requires your mongodb server to be run as a replica set\n\nSee the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/mongodb/connect-your-database-node-mongodb) for connecting to a MongoDB database.\n\n### I want to use Polaris v13.0.0 or higher\n\nCurrently, this template is set up to work on node v18.20 or higher. However, `@shopify/polaris` is limited to v12 because v13 can only run on node v20+.\n\nYou don't have to make any changes to the code in order to be able to upgrade Polaris to v13, but you'll need to do the following:\n\n- Upgrade your node version to v20.10 or higher.\n- Update your `Dockerfile` to pull `FROM node:20-alpine` instead of `node:18-alpine`\n\n### \"nbf\" claim timestamp check failed\n\nThis error will occur of the `nbf` claim timestamp check failed. This is because the JWT token is expired.\nIf you  are consistently getting this error, it could be that the clock on your machine is not in sync with the server.\n\nTo fix this ensure you have enabled `Set time and date automatically` in the `Date and Time` settings on your computer.\n\n## Benefits\n\nShopify apps are built on a variety of Shopify tools to create a great merchant experience.\n\n<!-- TODO: Uncomment this after we've updated the docs -->\n<!-- The [create an app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started/create) tutorial in our developer documentation will guide you through creating a Shopify app using this template. -->\n\nThe Remix app template comes with the following out-of-the-box functionality:\n\n- [OAuth](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-admin-requests): Installing the app and granting permissions\n- [GraphQL Admin API](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/shopify-app-remix#using-the-shopify-admin-graphql-api): Querying or mutating Shopify admin data\n- [Webhooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-js/tree/main/packages/shopify-app-remix#authenticating-webhook-requests): Callbacks sent by Shopify when certain events occur\n- [AppBridge](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge): This template uses the next generation of the Shopify App Bridge library which works in unison with previous versions.\n- [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/): Design system that enables apps to create Shopify-like experiences\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nThis template uses [Remix](https://remix.run).

Since the app launches automatically when the laptop or desktop starts and operates locally, it should provide a quick, actionable overview of all local projects and their statuses. Below, I’ll outline the key information to prioritize and how to structure the UI for the first screen to maximize its usefulness.\n\n### Information to Prioritize\nFor the app to be valuable, it should focus on the following pieces of information, which are critical for developers to manage their projects effectively:\n\n- **Project Name**: This is the primary identifier for each project, making it easy for the developer to recognize their work at a glance.\n- **Status**: Clearly indicate whether a project is **unfinished**, **dead**, or **finished**. This helps the developer quickly assess which projects require attention or can be ignored.\n- **Last Launched Date**: Show the date when the project was last opened through the app. This provides insight into recent activity and helps prioritize tasks, reflecting the developer’s interaction with the project via this tool.\n- **Project Path**: Store the file system path to the project directory. This is essential for enabling the \"Launch in VS Code\" feature, allowing seamless access to the project.\n\nThese elements ensure the app delivers concise, actionable data without overwhelming the user.\n\n### UI Structure for the First Screen\nThe first screen should be clean, intuitive, and focused on providing an immediate overview of projects, with quick access to key actions for unfinished projects. Here’s how it should be structured:\n\n#### **App Bar**\n- **Title**: Display the app name (e.g., \"Project Manager\") to provide context.\n- **Settings Icon**: Include an icon (e.g., a gear) on the right side that opens a settings page. This allows the developer to configure options like the VS Code executable path or app preferences.\n\n#### **Filter Tabs**\n- Provide a row of filter tabs below the app bar to sort projects by status:\n  - **All**: Shows every project regardless of status.\n  - **Unfinished**: Displays only unfinished projects (set as the default view).\n  - **Dead**: Shows projects marked as dead.\n  - **Finished**: Lists completed projects.\n- **Default View**: Set to \"Unfinished\" since these are the projects most likely needing attention when the developer starts their device. This focuses the app on actionable tasks right away.\n\n#### **Project Cards**\n- Use a scrollable list of cards to display projects based on the selected filter. Each card should include:\n  - **Project Name**: In bold text for emphasis and easy scanning.\n  - **Status**: Displayed with color-coding for quick recognition:\n    - Yellow for **unfinished** (indicating active work).\n    - Red for **dead** (signaling abandonment).\n    - Green for **finished** (showing completion).\n  - **Last Launched Date**: Shown as \"Last Launched: [date]\" to indicate the last time the project was opened via the app.\n  - **Actions for Unfinished Projects**:\n    - **\"Launch in VS Code\" Button**: A button that opens the project directory in VS Code using the stored project path.\n    - **Gravestone Icon**: A clickable icon (e.g., a tombstone) to mark the project as dead, updating its status in the database after a confirmation prompt.\n\n#### **Optional Enhancements**\n- **Search Bar**: Add a search field above the project list to let developers quickly find projects by name, enhancing usability for those with many projects.\n- **Project Counters**: Display a count in the app bar or near the filter tabs (e.g., \"Unfinished Projects: 5\") to give an instant sense of workload.\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Prioritized Information**: The focus on project name, status, last launched date, and path ensures the developer gets the most relevant details without clutter. The \"Last Launched\" date, updated when a project is opened via the app, keeps the info practical and tied to app usage.\n- **UI Design**: The app bar, filter tabs, and project cards create a structured, glanceable interface. Defaulting to unfinished projects aligns with the developer’s likely intent—starting work—while color-coded statuses and action buttons make it fast and easy to act on projects.\n- **Local Focus**: Since all operations are local, the SQLite database (with a simple table for id, name, status, path, and last_launched) and Flutter’s lightweight widgets ensure quick startup and responsiveness, fitting the autostart requirement.\n\nThis approach delivers a valuable tool that simplifies project management, keeps the developer focused, and integrates seamlessly into their workflow.",

      "content": "# dev_brief\n\nTo create a simple and valuable Flutter app with SQLite for developers to manage their local projects, you need to focus on delivering the most essential information and designing an intuitive first screen. Since the app launches automatically when the laptop or desktop starts and operates locally, it should provide a quick, actionable overview of all local projects and their statuses. Below, I’ll outline the key information to prioritize and how to structure the UI for the first screen to maximize its usefulness.\n\n### Information to Prioritize\nFor the app to be valuable, it should focus on the following pieces of information, which are critical for developers to manage their projects effectively:\n\n- **Project Name**: This is the primary identifier for each project, making it easy for the developer to recognize their work at a glance.\n- **Status**: Clearly indicate whether a project is **unfinished**, **dead**, or **finished**. This helps the developer quickly assess which projects require attention or can be ignored.\n- **Last Launched Date**: Show the date when the project was last opened through the app. This provides insight into recent activity and helps prioritize tasks, reflecting the developer’s interaction with the project via this tool.\n- **Project Path**: Store the file system path to the project directory. This is essential for enabling the \"Launch in VS Code\" feature, allowing seamless access to the project.\n\nThese elements ensure the app delivers concise, actionable data without overwhelming the user.\n\n### UI Structure for the First Screen\nThe first screen should be clean, intuitive, and focused on providing an immediate overview of projects, with quick access to key actions for unfinished projects. Here’s how it should be structured:\n\n#### **App Bar**\n- **Title**: Display the app name (e.g., \"Project Manager\") to provide context.\n- **Settings Icon**: Include an icon (e.g., a gear) on the right side that opens a settings page. This allows the developer to configure options like the VS Code executable path or app preferences.\n\n#### **Filter Tabs**\n- Provide a row of filter tabs below the app bar to sort projects by status:\n  - **All**: Shows every project regardless of status.\n  - **Unfinished**: Displays only unfinished projects (set as the default view).\n  - **Dead**: Shows projects marked as dead.\n  - **Finished**: Lists completed projects.\n- **Default View**: Set to \"Unfinished\" since these are the projects most likely needing attention when the developer starts their device. This focuses the app on actionable tasks right away.\n\n#### **Project Cards**\n- Use a scrollable list of cards to display projects based on the selected filter. Each card should include:\n  - **Project Name**: In bold text for emphasis and easy scanning.\n  - **Status**: Displayed with color-coding for quick recognition:\n    - Yellow for **unfinished** (indicating active work).\n    - Red for **dead** (signaling abandonment).\n    - Green for **finished** (showing completion).\n  - **Last Launched Date**: Shown as \"Last Launched: [date]\" to indicate the last time the project was opened via the app.\n  - **Actions for Unfinished Projects**:\n    - **\"Launch in VS Code\" Button**: A button that opens the project directory in VS Code using the stored project path.\n    - **Gravestone Icon**: A clickable icon (e.g., a tombstone) to mark the project as dead, updating its status in the database after a confirmation prompt.\n\n#### **Optional Enhancements**\n- **Search Bar**: Add a search field above the project list to let developers quickly find projects by name, enhancing usability for those with many projects.\n- **Project Counters**: Display a count in the app bar or near the filter tabs (e.g., \"Unfinished Projects: 5\") to give an instant sense of workload.\n\n### Why This Works\n- **Prioritized Information**: The focus on project name, status, last launched date, and path ensures the developer gets the most relevant details without clutter. The \"Last Launched\" date, updated when a project is opened via the app, keeps the info practical and tied to app usage.\n- **UI Design**: The app bar, filter tabs, and project cards create a structured, glanceable interface. Defaulting to unfinished projects aligns with the developer’s likely intent—starting work—while color-coded statuses and action buttons make it fast and easy to act on projects.\n- **Local Focus**: Since all operations are local, the SQLite database (with a simple table for id, name, status, path, and last_launched) and Flutter’s lightweight widgets ensure quick startup and responsiveness, fitting the autostart requirement.\n\nThis approach delivers a valuable tool that simplifies project management, keeps the developer focused, and integrates seamlessly into their workflow.\n\n\nadd a quotes tab :the magic you are looking for is in the work yo are avoiding\n",
